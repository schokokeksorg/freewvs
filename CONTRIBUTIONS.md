coding style
============

Code should conform to the PEP8 coding standard. Furthermore we enable additional rules
in pycodestyle and run some other linting tools (pylint, pyflakes, dlint).

The freewvsdb files should be linted JSON as created by json.dumps with 2 spaces
indenting.

All code and JSON style requirements can be checked by running the unit tests:

```
python -m unittest
```
